										<h2>My Philosophy</h2>
									</header>
									<h3>What I Believe</h3>

									<p>I provide personalized college counseling with respect to any and all aspects 
									of the college admissions process. I view each student as an individual and I 
									strive to understand and meet that student's needs. 
									One student may want general feedback or help in brainstorming a topic for a Common 
									Application essay; another may need guidance on how to put together memorable supplements. 
									Still others may need extensive editing in order to craft the perfect application essay 
									(a specialty!) – one that will let their voices shine through and allow colleges 
									to see them in the best light!</p>
									<p>I work with students and families at all stages of the college admissions process, 
									and can provide as much - or as little - help as they need along the way. 
									Some may prefer a step-by-step approach; others may just want someone to look over 
									their essays and provide some feedback. Some may need help deciding which high school 
									classes to take, how to make the most of their extracurricular activities, or where to 
									find summer programs and internships that will help them discover and follow their passions. 
									I can provide advice as to whether and when to take standardized tests, how to find colleges 
									that are the “right fit” for each student based on who they are as individuals and what they 
									want from their college experience.</p> 
									<p>I have a proven track record in helping our students gain admissions into top schools 
									and in finding niche programs that fit their individual wants and needs.</p>
